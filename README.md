# Steps

0. Develop object tracking algorithm based on features similarities comparison with rgb only

   1. Made by Nacim Bouia, but unavailable at the moment

1. Develop object tracking algorithm based on features similarities comparison with depth only

   1. Use detection or segmentation to extract object from frame
      1. Detection (done)
   2. Extract depth from center or centroid of the object
   3. Replace depth's object for center depth
   4. Save image
   5. Apply feature extraction over frame
   6. Compare using depth-only
   7. Apply masks over original frame
   8. Generate video with mask

2. Develop object tracking algorithm based on features similarities comparison with depth + rgb features

## Tasks

- Find a time with Nacim for explaining repo code
- Read labels from segmented images as find its centroid
